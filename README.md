# Web Development Project 5 - *Pet Finder Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Henry Liu**

This web app: **A site that utlizes Petfinder's API to display a list of pets available for adoption in Chicago.**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [X] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [X] *Number of Results*
  - [X] *Location*
  - [X] *Search Filter*
- [X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [X] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [X] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

## Notes

Similar to the last project, I spent a huge portion of time going through the API documentation. 
This time, the API was much more difficult to work with because their examples utilized cURL instead of fetch,
but thankfully, I could use this [resource](https://kigiri.github.io/fetch/) to help translate cURL commands to fetch. 
I also spent a huge chunk of time trying to implement the functionality to implement multiple filters simulatenously, but I finally
understood this as one of the applications of useEffect. Overall, this project was challenging in the right amount, and I learned a lot.
There's still a lot of room for improvement when it comes to writing cleaner and more organized code.
